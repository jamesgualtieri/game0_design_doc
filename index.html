<p>This is how the game looks. Your avatar is in a kitchen that is O-shaped with various stations. The goal of the game is to serve a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>
The game starts with a randomized kitchen layout. Move the avatar around collecting the ingredients. Once you have collected all 3 ingredients move the assembled sandwhich to the serve area. The level will reset and randomize. The game ends when the user quits.
